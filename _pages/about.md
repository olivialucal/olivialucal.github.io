My name is Cliff Johnson and I am a Research Assistant Professor at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/) in [CIERA](https://ciera.northwestern.edu/) and the [Dept. of Physics and Astronomy](https://physics.northwestern.edu/), and the Co-Director & Science Lead of the [Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org/) at the [Adler Planetarium](https://www.adlerplanetarium.org/).

My current research focuses on understanding star formation behavior at spatial scales ranging from that of galaxies down to individual star-forming complexes through the combined study of stellar populations and the interstellar medium. Specifically, I study the formation and evolution of star cluster populations and young pre-main sequence star populations in the Local Group, focusing on how star and cluster formation processes depend on galactic environment. Citizen science and crowdsourcing are important tools in my research.
